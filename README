How to build:

Inside the CppUnit directory do:
    ./autogen.sh 
    ./configure 
    make

From the root directory of the project do:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make


To run the main program type './bosch_queue' from the build directory.


To run the CppUnit tests run './test/test_queue' from the build directory.


The documentation for the class shall be generated in build/doc/html/classQueue.html
