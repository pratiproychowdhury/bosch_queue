                           ARCHIVED
                           --------

This repository is archived. It used to be necessary to build and run
the tests on CuraEngine: https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine
However CuraEngine has since switched to a different testing framework.

Ultimaker has contributed a CMake build system to this repository. You
may fork the repository and use it according to CppUnit's license. But
we never intended to maintain this project beyond Ultimaker's needs
for it. For future contributions, we refer you to FreeDesktop's
efforts to maintain the library:

For questions about this archival, contact Ghostkeeper (using the
e-mail address in one of his recent commits).
